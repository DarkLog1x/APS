                <pre>TL:DR - Yubikey is an awesome little tool that streamlines GoPass on-top of all the other great things it does.</pre>
<p id="mcetoc_1dgualr1f2">I use GoPass to store my passwords. Its a great tool that I would recommend everyone use if you are familiar with cli. Side note, if you are not using any password manager then shame on you, its 2019 there are a plethora of good ones to choose from (pass/gopass, lastpass[paid], and KeePassX) alongside many more.</p>
<p>The one downside I always had with GoPass was that I would have to always type my GPG master password to unencrypted my passwords every time I needed one. This took time and depending on my coffee consumption several attempts to get right.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1dgucntm80">The best guide that I have found on setting up my Yubkey with GPG is drduh's github guide at <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide">YubiKey-Guide</a>. It is clean, consice and easy to follow. </p>
<p>Once you have your GPG keys and subkeys created then stored on your Yubkey it is as simple as running GoPass and typing in your Yubikey password. </p>
